In 2015, Google releases full source of chromium for android, including browser UI. It means that base on chromium open source project, you can build a android browser as powerful as Chrome for Android. But for most android developer, chromium project is huge and difficult to customize. This project extracts sources and libraries built from chromium, so that you can put emphasis on UI customize. Please use Android Studio as your development environment.
